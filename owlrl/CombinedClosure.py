"""
The combined closure: performing *both* the OWL 2 RL and RDFS closures.

The two are very close but there are some rules in RDFS that are not in OWL 2 RL (eg, the axiomatic
triples concerning the container membership properties). Using this closure class the
OWL 2 RL implementation becomes a full extension of RDFS.

    Common subclass of the RDFS and OWL 2 RL semantic classes. All methods simply call back
    to the functions in the superclasses. This may lead to some unnecessary duplication of terms

    ie, Resource being the same as Thing and OWL and RDFS classes being identical are added to the
    triple store.

    extend the standard functionality by extending this class. This class *always*} performs RDFS inferences.

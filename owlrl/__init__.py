"""
This module is a brute force implementation of the 'finite' version of `RDFS semantics`_ and of `OWL 2 RL`_ on the top
of RDFLib (with some caveats, see below). Some extensions to these are also implemented.

.. _RDFS semantics: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/
.. _OWL 2 RL: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#Reasoning_in_OWL_2_RL_and_RDF_Graphs_using_Rules

Brute force means that, in all cases, simple forward chaining rules are used to extend (recursively) the incoming graph
with all triples that the rule sets permit (ie, the "deductive closure" of the graph is computed).
There is an extra options whether the axiomatic triples are added to the graph (prior to the forward chaining step).
These, typically set the domain and range for properties or define some core classes.
In the case of RDFS, the implementation uses a 'finite' version of the axiomatic triples only (as proposed, for example,
by Herman ter Horst). This means that it adds only those :code:`rdf:_i` type predicates that do appear in the original graph,
thereby keeping this step finite. For OWL 2 RL, OWL 2 does not define axiomatic triples formally; but they can be
deduced from the `OWL 2 RDF Based Semantics`_ document and are listed in Appendix 6 (though informally).

.. _OWL 2 RDF Based Semantics: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-rdf-based-semantics/

.. note:: This implementation adds only those triples that refer to OWL terms that are meaningful for the OWL 2 RL case.


Package Entry Points
====================

The main entry point to the package is via the :class:`.DeductiveClosure` class. This class should be
initialized to control the parameters of the deductive closure; the forward chaining is done via the
L{expand<owlrl.DeductiveClosure.expand>} method.
The simplest way to use the package from an RDFLib application is as follows::

    graph = Graph()                                 # creation of an RDFLib graph
    ...
    ...                                             # normal RDFLib application, eg, parsing RDF data
    ...
    DeductiveClosure(OWLRL_Semantics).expand(graph) # calculate an OWL 2 RL deductive closure of graph
                                                    # without axiomatic triples

The first argument of the :class:`.DeductiveClosure` initialization can be replaced by other classes, providing different
types of deductive closure; other arguments are also possible. For example::

 DeductiveClosure(OWLRL_Extension, rdfs_closure = True, axiomatic_triples = True, datatype_axioms = True).expand(graph)

This will calculate the deductive closure including RDFS and some extensions to OWL 2 RL, and with all possible axiomatic
triples added to the graph (this is about the maximum the package can do…)

The same instance of :class:`.DeductiveClosure` can be used for several graph expansions. In other words, the
expand function does not change any state.

For convenience, a second entry point to the package is provided in the form of a function called
:func:`owlrl.convert_graph`, that expects a directory with various options, including a file name. The function
parses the file, creates the expanded graph, and serializes the result into RDF/XML or Turtle. This function is
particularly useful as an entry point for a CGI call (where the HTML form parameters are in a directory) and is easy to
use with a command line interface. The package distribution contains an example for both.

There are major closure type (ie, semantic closure possibilities); these can be controlled through the appropriate
parameters of the :class:`.DeductiveClosure` class:

    * using the :class:`.RDFS_Semantics` class, implementing the `RDFS semantics`_.

    .. _RDFS semantics: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/

    * using the :class:`.OWLRL.OWLRL_Semantics` class, implementing the `OWL 2 RL`_.

    .. _OWL 2 RL: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#Reasoning_in_OWL_2_RL_and_RDF_Graphs_using_Rules

    * using :class:`.CombinedClosure.RDFS_OWLRL_Semantics` class, implementing a combined semantics of `RDFS semantics`_ and `OWL 2 RL`_.

    .. _RDFS semantics: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/
    .. _OWL 2 RL: http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#Reasoning_in_OWL_2_RL_and_RDF_Graphs_using_Rules

In all three cases there are other dimensions that can control the exact closure being generated:

    * for convenience, the so called axiomatic triples (see, eg, the `axiomatic triples in RDFS`_ are, by default, I{not} added to the graph closure to reduce the number of generated triples. These can be controlled through a separate initialization argument.

    .. _axiomatic triples in RDFS: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#rdfs_interp

    * similarly, the axiomatic triples for D-entailment are separated.

Some Technical/implementation aspects
=====================================

The core processing is done in the in the :class:`.Closure.Core` class, which is subclassed by the
:class:`.RDFSClosure.RDFS_Semantics` and the :class:`.OWLRL.OWLRL_Semantics` classes (these two are then, on their turn,
subclassed by the :class:`.CombinedClosure.RDFS_OWLRL_Semantics` class). The core implements the core functionality of
cycling through the rules, whereas the rules themselves are defined and implemented in the subclasses. There are also
methods that are executed only once either at the beginning or at the end of the full processing cycle. Adding axiomatic
triples is handled separately, which allows a finer user control over these features.

The OWL specification includes references to datatypes that are not in the core RDFS specification, consequently not
directly implemented by RDFLib. These are added in a separate module of the package.


Problems with Literals with datatypes
-------------------------------------

The current distribution of RDFLib is fairly poor in handling datatypes, particularly in checking whether a lexical form
of a literal is "proper" as for its declared datatype. A typical example is ::

  "-1234"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger

which should not be accepted as valid literal. Because the requirements of OWL 2 RL are much stricter in this respect,
an alternative set of datatype handling (essentially, conversions) had to be implemented (see the :py:mod:`.XsdDatatypes`
module).

The :class:`.DeductiveClosure` class has an additional instance variable whether
the default RDFLib conversion routines should be exchanged against the new ones. If this flag is set to True and
instance creation (this is the default), then the conversion routines are set back to the originals once the expansion
is complete, thereby avoiding to influence older application that may not work properly with the new set of conversion
routines.

If the user wants to use these alternative lexical conversions everywhere in the application, then
the :py:meth:`.DeductiveClosure.use_improved_datatypes_conversions` method can be invoked.
That method changes the conversion routines and, from that point on, all usage of :class:`.DeductiveClosure` instances
will use the improved conversion methods without resetting them. Ie, the code structure can be something like::

    DeductiveClosure().use_improved_datatypes_conversions()
    ... RDFLib application
    DeductiveClosure().expand(graph)
    ...


The default situation can be set back using the
:py:meth:`.DeductiveClosure.use_rdflib_datatypes_conversions` call.

It is, however, not *required* to use these methods at all. I.e., the user can use::

    DeductiveClosure(improved_datatypes=False).expand(graph)


which will result in a proper graph expansion except for the datatype specific comparisons which will be incomplete.

OWL-RL
======

A simple implementation of the OWL2 RL Profile, as well as a basic RDFS inference, on top of RDFLib, based on forward chaining.

This package is a Python library that also contains a couple of scripts:

* `scripts/RDFConvertService`: a CGI script to invoke the library. It may have to be adapted to the local server setup.

* `scripts/owlrl`: a script that can be run locally on to transform a file into RDF (on the standard output). Run the script with `-h` to get the available flags.

Installation
------------

This package requires RDFLib 7.1.3 as its only dependency and it can be installed from the Python Package index in the usual way:

::

    pip install owlrl


or

::

    poetry add owlrl


Use
---

This package can run inference according to RDFS and/or OWL-RL.

For details on RDFS, see the `RDF Semantics Specification`_; for OWL 2 RL, see the `OWL 2 Profile specification`_.
